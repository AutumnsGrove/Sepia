# Slices

Sepia is built as **vertical slices**, one plan file each, so any agent can pick one up cold, build it test
first, and leave the app working and releasable. Standing rules, invariants, gates and the definition of done
are in [`../BUILD.md`](../BUILD.md). **Read it first**, then [`../STANDARDS.md`](../STANDARDS.md). The status column
is the truth: S00 and S02 to S09 are built, and S10 is next.

## How to read a slice plan

Every plan has the same sections: **Purpose**, **Depends on** (and what it can run in parallel with),
**Where we start**, **Settled** (only decisions already recorded, with where), **Scope** (numbered stages,
each small enough for one sitting), **Tests and exit** (the happy, bad and sad routes, named), **Gates**,
**Open questions** and **Done when**. A plan states only what is settled. Anything unsettled is an open
question to be asked in a batch before the slice starts and recorded in the plan's Decisions section; a slice
with an unanswered question is not ready. Items marked *assumed, confirm* are defaults taken from Ivy or
Polaris that the operator has not yet signed off.

## What a slice leaves behind

- Tests (happy, bad, sad) and any fuzz targets with seed corpora.
- The `world` fake for anything new it talks to.
- A passing `make check` and green required CI checks.
- Updated specs, a line in [`../BUILD-LOG.md`](../BUILD-LOG.md), and this table's status.

## Order and dependencies

**Foundation first.** S00 then S02 and S03 unblock everything. After S02 (the contract) and S03 (pure types)
the work fans out: **S04, S05, S06 can run in parallel**, and the whole frontend stream (S10, S11, S12) can run
against the contract and the world without waiting for the agent. S07 needs S04. S08 needs S05, S06 and S07.
S09 needs S02, S07 and S08. S13 needs a working app (S09 and S12).

**Parallel streams.** Two agents can work at once from S02 on:

| Stream | Slices | Talks to the other through |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | S03, S04, S05, S06, S07, S08, S09 | `api/` contract and golden examples |
| Frontend | S10, S11, S12 | `api/` contract, `sepia-dev` and the world |

## Phase gates

| Phase | Ends when | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | The spikes are written up and the open questions are closed | G8 |
| 1 | A review typed as a sentence is a saved entry on the potato, the app has updated itself and rolled back a failed update, and a nightly backup is in R2 | G5, G6, G8 |
| 2 | Four media coexist in one library, search works, the general chat works | G8 |
| 3 | Ten real Fable reviews have been imported and read back correctly | G7, G8 |
| 4 | An export, a wipe and an import diff clean, and an R2 restore has really happened | G8 |

## What is real and what is mocked today

S00 and S02 through S09 are built: the service skeleton and its Host and Origin checks, the contract and its
generators, the pure domain core, the database with its triggers and repositories, the question banks and
decisions layer that reads [`../../config/`](../../config/), the TMDB and Open Library clients with their covers,
the session engine, the agent pipeline with its tools, guards, corpus and fake-model runner, and the HTTP and
WebSocket server that drives the whole logging flow, including its lifecycle: the slow-client shed, the reconnect
storm, a restart mid-turn, a database failure and the bounded soak. Everything from S10 on is still plan, spec and
mockup. The decisions backend, the two metadata providers, Polaris and R2 are reachable only through the fakes in
`internal/world`; `sepia-dev` runs the real service against them, offline, with no keys. The live calls against
the real providers are the operator's.
