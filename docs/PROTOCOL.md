# The session protocol

How the browser and the Go service talk during a session. Specified before code because the UI mockups
must show every state this protocol can produce. Decisions are from the 2026-10-31 planning session.

Principles, in the order they matter:

1. **A small Sepia vocabulary.** The browser never sees nova's events. The service translates them
   (section 7), so a nova change cannot break the frontend.
2. **The server owns the state.** The socket is a window onto a session, not the session itself. A turn
   keeps running if the phone sleeps, and a reconnecting client catches up.
3. **Snapshots, not patches.** The draft card is small, so every change sends the whole card with a
   version number.
4. **Everything the UI asks the user is one mechanism:** an `interaction_request` answered by an
   `interaction_response`.

## 1. Connection

- `GET /ws/sessions/{session_id}?last_seq=N` upgrades to a WebSocket. `last_seq` is the highest sequence
  number the client has seen (0 for a fresh connection).
- **One socket per open session.** Library, drafts count, search and entry pages are plain REST that
  refresh when the app regains focus. A new session is created with `POST /api/sessions`
  (`{kind: "entry" | "general"}`) before connecting.
- **Host and Origin checks.** `Host` is checked against an allow-list on every request (the tailnet name and
  loopback), which defeats DNS rebinding, where `Origin` and `Host` are both the attacker's name.
- **Origin check on the upgrade, and on every state-changing request.** Browsers do not apply the
  same-origin rule to WebSockets, and this app has no login, so a hostile page opened on a phone that is
  on the tailnet could otherwise reach it. The service accepts only its own origin
  (`https://lepotato.taild95077.ts.net:8893`, and `http://localhost:*` in dev). JSON POSTs also require
  `Content-Type: application/json`, which a cross-site form cannot send.
- **Heartbeat.** The server sends a ping every 20 s. A client that hears nothing for 45 s treats the
  socket as dead and reconnects.
- **Reconnect.** Backoff of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 s, capped at 15 s, with jitter, and an immediate attempt when
  the page becomes visible again (the phone woke up). Always with the current `last_seq`.
- **A turn does not depend on the socket.** If the client disappears mid-reply, the server finishes the
  turn and logs the events. Stopping is explicit (`stop`).

## 2. Envelope

Every server message is one JSON object:

```json
{ "seq": 41, "type": "text_delta", "session_id": "s_8f2", "ts": "2026-10-31T14:03:22Z", "data": { } }
```

- **Persisted events** carry a `seq`, strictly increasing within the session, and are replayed on resume.
- **Live-only events** have `"seq": null`, are never replayed, and a client must treat their absence as
  normal. (The same convention Polaris uses for `cost_update`.)

Every client message carries a `client_msg_id` (a UUID the client makes), so a retry after a reconnect
cannot be applied twice.

**Money is always two numbers.** A call reports what it consumed and where that figure came from: the
provider's own report, a plan's allowance, or Sepia's price-list estimate. A covered call is not money spent,
so every cost on the wire carries `total_usd` and `covered_usd` together, and an estimated total says so. A
screen that shows only the total would bill her for an allowance she has already paid for.

## 3. Server to client

| Type | Persisted | Data | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hello` | no | `session`, `state`, `draft` (latest snapshot or null), `open_interactions[]`, `head_seq`, `full_state`, `server_version` | Sent first on every connect. If `full_state` is true the client rebuilds from this and ignores replay (the log was compacted past `last_seq`). If `server_version` differs from the version the page was loaded with, the client reloads, so an old frontend never talks to a new server after an update |
| `user_message` | yes | `message_id`, `client_msg_id`, `text` | The persisted ID of what I typed, sent as soon as it is saved, so the UI can show it and retry or edit from it |
| `preread` | yes | `odds` (every check), `fired`, `cost_usd` | The decisions result for this message. Feeds the "why" sheet |
| `activity` | no | `label` (for example "Reading", "Looking up TMDB") | Drives the small progress indicator while the agent works |
| `assistant_start` | yes | `message_id` | A reply is beginning |
| `text_delta` | yes | `message_id`, `text` | One chunk of the reply |
| `assistant_end` | yes | `message_id` | The reply is complete |
| `tool_start` | yes | `tool`, `label` | A tool call began; `label` is a friendly string |
| `tool_end` | yes | `tool`, `ok`, `inputs`, `summary`, `sources[]`, `cost_usd` | The call finished. `inputs` and `sources` feed the "why" sheet; `summary` is one line |
| `interaction_request` | yes | `interaction_id`, `kind`, `payload` | The service needs something from me (section 4) |
| `interaction_resolved` | yes | `interaction_id`, `by` (`user` or `server`) | The request was answered or withdrawn; other devices clear it |
| `draft_snapshot` | yes | `version`, `draft` | The whole entry card, after any change. See [`ENTRY_CARD.md`](ENTRY_CARD.md) |
| `saved` | yes | `entry_id`, `version` | The entry was committed. The session closes after this |
| `discarded` | yes | none | The draft was discarded. The session closes after this |
| `ack` | no | `client_msg_id`, `status` (`accepted`, `duplicate`, `rejected`), `reason?` | The reply to a client message. A `duplicate` returns the original outcome |
| `cost_update` | no | `session_total_usd`, `session_covered_usd` | The running total for the session and the part of it a plan's allowance paid for. Always the full totals, never deltas; the UI overwrites. `covered` is part of `total`, never in addition to it |
| `notice` | yes | `level` (`info`, `warn`), `code`, `text` | Something the user should know, such as "the pre-read was unavailable for this message" |
| `error` | yes | `code`, `message`, `retryable` | A failure. `retryable` tells the UI whether to offer Try again |
| `queue_update` | no | `queued` (count) | A message I sent mid-turn is waiting for the current turn to finish |

## 4. Interactions

One mechanism for every question the service asks me. `interaction_request.kind` decides the payload:

| `kind` | When | Payload | Response `value` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `choose_medium` | The medium read is split | `options[]` (for example book, film) | the chosen option |
| `choose_candidate` | After a lookup | `candidates[]` (3 to 5, each with provider, id, title, year, creator, medium, thumb) and a "none of these" | a candidate id, or `none` |
| `describe` | The Describe it step | `categories[]` (id, label, `covered` when I already mentioned it, `tags[]` of `{value, label, tone}`, `hints[]` of tag values) | `selected` (a map of category id to tag values), or `skip_all`. Hints are never pre-selected |
| `question_form` | The single questions that remain | `questions[]` (id, prompt, type, options, optional `hint`), at most three | `answers[]`, with skipped questions marked, or `skip_all` |
| `revisit_choice` | The work is already in the library | the previous entry's summary | `new_entry` or `edit_existing` |
| `fill_gap` | A required piece is missing and cannot be parsed (a rating, a few words of review) | `field`, `prompt` | the value |
| `lookup_failed` | A metadata service errored, timed out or found nothing | `service`, `reason`, `can_ask_polaris` | `retry`, `ask_polaris` or `log_without_details` |

The `hint` on a question is the suggested answer: shown as a tappable hint, **never pre-selected**.

An interaction stays open until resolved. Drafts never expire, so neither do interactions. If I type a
normal message while one is open, the session bias rule in
[`decisions/policy.yaml`](../config/decisions/policy.yaml) decides whether it answers the interaction or starts
something new.

## 5. Client to server

| Type | Data | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `message` | `text`, `attachments[]` (media ids), `client_date`, `tz` | A normal chat message; `attachments` are images already uploaded to the session (Phase 3). The date and timezone make "last night" resolve against where I am |
| `interaction_response` | `interaction_id`, `value` | Answers an open interaction; this is the tool result the agent is waiting on |
| `draft_edit` | `base_version`, `set` (field to value map) | Direct edit of the card. Stale `base_version` means `rejected` plus a fresh `draft_snapshot` |
| `accept_unverified` | `base_version`, `fields[]` or `all` | Accept web-derived or manual fields into the canonical work |
| `include_left_out` | `base_version`, `segment_id` | Move a left-out segment into the body |
| `confirm` | `base_version` | The one commit. Rejected if the version is stale or the card does not satisfy section 2 of `ENTRY_CARD.md` |
| `reopen` | `entry_id` | Opens a draft revision of a saved entry, so Edit on a saved card needs no new lookup. The session must be active and have no card yet, and the entry must be saved and not deleted. Confirming keeps the previous version in the revisions table |
| `discard` | none | Throw the draft away; the session closes |
| `stop` | none | Cancel the turn in flight |
| `ping` | none | Optional keepalive from the client |

Every message gets an `ack`. A `rejected` ack always says why, and for version conflicts is followed by
the current `draft_snapshot`.

## 6. Ordering, concurrency, resume

- **One turn at a time per session.** A `message` that arrives mid-turn is queued behind it (shown with a
  `queue_update`), one deep. A second one is rejected until the first is taken.
- **Two devices on one session is fine.** Every event goes to both. The draft `version` increments on every
  change, whoever made it. An edit made against an old version is rejected and the editor is sent the
  current snapshot. The first `confirm` wins; the other device then receives `saved`.
- **Offline outbox.** While the socket is down, the client keeps what I type, marked "will send when you are back online", and sends it on reconnect with its original `client_msg_id`, so a message typed in a tunnel is neither lost nor sent twice.
- **Idempotency.** The server remembers each `client_msg_id` for the life of the session. A repeat gets
  `ack: duplicate` carrying the first outcome, and changes nothing.
- **Resume.** On connect with `last_seq=N`, the server sends `hello`, then replays every persisted event
  with `seq > N` in order, then streams live. If it cannot (the log was compacted past N), `hello` says
  `full_state: true` and the client rebuilds from the snapshot in `hello`.
- **Log size.** `text_delta` events are compacted into the final message when a turn ends. The log is for
  resume only; the conversation itself is stored in `sessions.messages_json` and survives.

## 7. How nova's events map

The service translates inside, so the browser sees only section 3.

| Nova | Sepia |
|---|---|
| `text_delta` | `text_delta` |
| `message_start` / `message_end` | `assistant_start` / `assistant_end` |
| `tool_start` / `tool_end` | `tool_start` / `tool_end` (inputs and sources attached) |
| `ask_reviewer`, `media_lookup` results needing a choice | `interaction_request` |
| `usage` | `cost_update` |
| `retry`, `compaction` | `notice` |
| `error` | `error` |
| `thinking_*` | dropped (not shown in v1) |

The pre-read and the fidelity check are not nova events. The service runs them through nova's `decide`
package and emits `preread` itself.

## 8. REST outline

Plain requests, all behind the same origin check. Detailed shapes belong with the code, not here.

- `POST /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}`, `GET /api/sessions?state=active` (the Drafts list),
  `GET /api/sessions?kind=general` (past library chats, newest first)
- `GET /api/entries`, `GET /api/entries/{id}`, `GET /api/entries/{id}/revisions`,
  `POST /api/entries/{id}/delete` (soft; plain entry view only)
- `GET /api/works/{id}`, `GET /api/search?q=`
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/media` (multipart upload, returns a `media_id`), `GET /media/{id}` (Phase 3)
- `GET /covers/{id}` (static), `GET /healthz`, `POST /api/export`
- `GET /api/version`, `POST /api/update/check`, `GET /api/update/available`, `POST /api/update/start`, `GET /api/update/status`, `POST /api/restart`, `GET /api/services` (see [`UPDATE.md`](UPDATE.md))

## 9. Fixture cases to write

- reconnect with `last_seq` mid-reply: no lost or duplicated text;
- reconnect after compaction: `full_state` rebuild matches the live state;
- the same `client_msg_id` sent twice: one effect;
- a stale `base_version` edit: rejected, snapshot returned, no change;
- two clients, concurrent `confirm`: exactly one `saved`;
- a message arriving mid-turn: queued, then processed in order;
- a hostile `Origin` on the upgrade and on a POST: refused;
- the decisions backend unavailable: a `notice`, and the turn still completes.
